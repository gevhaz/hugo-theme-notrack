    {{% resume-section title="About Me" %}}
My career has been a series of ups and downs, starting out as a child
prodigy, getting involved in religious sectarianism which earned me a
life sentence, which I fortunately were able to circumvent, followed by
prestigious academic and diplomatic roles and finally by barely surviving being
shipwrecked.

Pensionary is a type of governor role in the Netherlands.

1.  I dealt with issues of the freedom of the seas.
3.  I led a delegation to England in protest of the English actions, who had
    seized Dutch vessels under the claim that they were trespassing on British
    sea.
4.  While the protest was unsuccessful, the principles I argued for later became
    international law.
