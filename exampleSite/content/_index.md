Hello, I'm Hugo Grotius and this is my personal page. I'm a Dutch lawyer and
diplomat with experience from academia and government, having published a large
number of books on international law, sometimes even being called the "father"
of this field of study. I have experience working as a diplomat from serving as
the Swedish Ambassador to France. For a more comprehensive list of my experience,
see the [Resume]({{< ref "resume.md" >}}) tab.

After having been wrongfully convicted of treason in the Netherlands and
being handed a life sentence, I managed to escape with the help of my dear
wife Maria. She brought a chest of books to the prison where I was incarcerated
(nothing out of the ordinary since I am an avid reader) which was then
transported back out of the prison, with the the books replaced by yours truly!

I have a small gallery of works of art depicting me under the [Gallery]({{< ref "hugo-gallery.md" >}}) tab.
I regularly post lorem ipsum om my [Blog]({{< ref "blog/_index.md" >}}), and
there are also examples of how to include images in the theme of the site.
If you want to get in touch, you can find my social media links and email
address under the [Contact]({{< ref "contact.md" >}}) tab.
